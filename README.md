# SimpleWeatherApp

This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display the weather in a city inserted by the user.

<em>Instructions</em>: <br>
1- Open the project <br>
2- Type the name of the desired city in the search bar. <br>
3- click on the "check" button or hit enter. <br>

I made this project as a part of learning <strong>Web Development</strong>. <br>

<em>How the project works</em>: <br>
After entering the city name and <em>hitting enter</em> or <em>clicking the "check" button</em>, the script <em>fetches</em> data about the weather of the written city from the server of <em>openweathermap.org</em>. If the response is a valid city, it is displayed in the HTML page, otherwise a message is displayed stating that the input is invalid. <br>

<em>Notes</em> : <br>
-The kind of invalid input this project handles are <strong>Numbers</strong>, <strong>invalid city names</strong> and, <strong>empty inputs.</strong><br>
